Bugs:


To Add:
	- Apply Sumneko and update Utility.
	- Change the mod default setting for the research institute to be enabled as per science pack. As we default biter killing for coin generation.
	- OLD entry, not sure if still valid.... put SP/regular delivery of coins and include use of the item delivery pod ship. At present started this, but not convinced about how to do it.
	- Special coin collection chests. Options for both the coins generated by turrets and players to go in to these chests. Just fills up the first specila chest in the list and then fills up the next one. If the chest is full then drop the coins in the ground where the biter died.
