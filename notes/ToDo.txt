-  Science to coin feature: Private Research Institute:
	+ recipes to convert the sciences in the most user friendly way to coins.
	+ a mod setting to control the "value loss" of science to coins.
    - support a way to have very high loss rate and still get a whole number of coins out.
    - have an addiitonal building and recipe that takes one of each science pack and gives coins for those based on the loss ratio still.

- generate coins for kills:
	- option to players when they kill biters, worms and nests.
	- option to pay defences and other killers.
	- Settings for if coins go to player inventories, ground at kill site, some sort of special chest at spawn. Basically options to avoid the dropping on ground annoyance.
